# 📊 Data Science Project: Analyzing Data Scientist Salaries 💼💰

Welcome to my **Data Science Project** on analyzing **Data Scientist Salaries**! 🚀 In this repository, I walk you through the process of exploring and analyzing salary data for data scientists. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building predictive models, and ultimately preparing the project for deployment.

## 📅 Project Phases

The project is divided into key phases:

1. **Data Collection** 📥: Gathering salary-related data for data scientists from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning** 🧹: Cleaning and preparing the data, including handling missing values, correcting errors, and formatting issues.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Analyzing the data to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to salary distributions, geographic differences, experience levels, and more.
4. **Model Building** 🛠️: Building regression models or classification models to predict salaries based on relevant features.
5. **Productionization** 🚀: Deploying the model so it can be used by others to make salary predictions or get insights.

## 🧩 Project Ideation

For the ideation of this project, I've followed two approaches:

1. **Exploring Available Data** 🌐: Sourcing salary datasets from platforms like Kaggle and other public data repositories.
2. **Creating Your Own Project Idea** 💡: Thinking through what aspects influence data scientist salaries (e.g., experience, education, location) and searching for data that represents these variables.

This series covers both approaches and helps you understand how to gather data to suit your project idea.

## 🎬 Series Overview

This project series is **mostly unedited**, giving you a transparent look at the entire process: from getting stuck and problem-solving to building the final product. It’s a real-time view of working through challenges and finding solutions.

## 🔄 What's Included

- A detailed breakdown of how to analyze salary data for data scientists.
- Hands-on exploration of **real-world data science challenges**.
- **Step-by-step walkthrough** of the entire data science workflow, from ideation to model deployment.

## 🚀 Stay Updated

I will continue updating this repository as I progress with each phase of the project. Be sure to **follow** the project and watch how it evolves.
